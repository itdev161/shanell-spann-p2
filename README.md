Hello. This is my final project for the ITDEV-161, Web Programming 1 Course. In this project I am doing a deeper dive into ReactJS by programming a weather app. I will be using an API from Open Weather, a free weather data source. Also, I will attempt to call an image from Unsplash's embedding tool, a lightweight version of their API. 

Once completed, I hope to accomplish displaying the weather based on a user's location.
